# Browser
* Commit view
* Move commit body logic into djhtml
* Better links: image links, doc links and style
* Figure out p/pre/code borders so that selecting doesn't have
  apparent leading spaces
* Figure out whether code elements can clip text. (maybe minimal scroll bars
  where needed?)
* In Commit class, make a shorter (but still plenty long enough) sha

# Distribution
* setup.py stuff to install tsv

# Eventually
* Syntax highlighting
* Nicer diffs
* How to render different file types
* Display defaults
